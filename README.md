# 1. Introduction

This project provides a collection of sample applications for instrumenting **srsRAN** using the  
[jbpf](https://github.com/microsoft/jbpf) and [jrt-controller](https://github.com/microsoft/jrt-controller) frameworks.

# 2. Significant Commits / Features

[Jan 7, 2026] - Disaggregated RAN Components with JRTC Support

- All srsRAN components (srscu, srscucp, srscuup, srsdu, gnb) are now built with JRTC/JBPF enabled
- Added comprehensive documentation for disaggregated deployments
- Docker images now include all O-RAN split architecture binaries
- See [docs/disaggregated-ran.md](./docs/disaggregated-ran.md) for deployment scenarios

[Jan 6, 2026,  commit 792a739](https://github.com/microsoft/jrtc-apps/commit/5f02871cc8a7bccbddc72c39891fa0bfbf97788c) - Auto-loading of codelets, ZMQ mode
 
- Codelets can now be passed as command line arguments to __install.sh__, and are automatically loaded.
- To facilitate this, the startup sequence has been extended, and the codelets are only loaded once the gNB has successfully connected to the AMF.

- New support for running gNB in ZMQ mode, using GnuRadioCompanion and ZMQ mode srsUEs.
  - gNB runs on ZMQ mode, and multiple ZMQ UEs register and automatically start iPerf.

[Oct 17, 2025,  commit 792a739](https://github.com/microsoft/jrtc-apps/commit/792a739ec3a126948469cc4c87d248d716c7adf1) - Dynamic slice allocation

- Multiple modifications were implemented to support dynamic reconfiguration of spectrum PRB allocations across slices. These changes include:-
  - Updates to srsRAN to add the __mac_sched_slice_mgmt__ control hook, and some related mapping functions.
  - Added [slice_mgmt control codelet](./codelets/slice_mgmt/).
  - Added [slice_mgmt Jrtc application](./jrtc_apps/slice_mgmt/), used in conjunction with the codelet.

[Sep 10, 2025,  commit bdc858c](https://github.com/microsoft/jrtc-apps/commit/bdc858c2f27f4d903f6466406f7514faf677d364) - srsRAN v25.04 support

- Upgrade Jrtc to srsRAN v25.04
  - Updates to flags required for building srsRAN images.
  - Updates to numerous [codelets](./codelets) to align with latest srsRAN header files.
  - Improvements to [Dashboard](./jrtc_apps/dashboard/).

[Aug 8, 2025,  commit 0176d4c](https://github.com/microsoft/jrtc-apps/commit/0176d4cafdbc491f3948b6cb2a31864e5518b604) - Dashboard visualisations

- Final update to Dashboard visualisation (Azure Log Analytics) for srsRAN v23.04

# 3. Getting Started

The simplest way to get started is by using Kubernetes. This is the default installation method and helps eliminate any dependency-related issues.
However, we also support bare-metal installations.
For bare-metal setup instructions, please follow [these instructions](docs/baremetal.md) 

## 3.1. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that **Kubernetes** and **Helm** are installed and configured. 
If you are not an expert in Kubernetes, you can try one of the simple, single-node setups, such as [k3d](https://k3s.io/). 
This guide assumes **srsRAN** will be deployed using **Helm**.

## 3.2. Preparing the Environment

### 3.2.1. Initialize submodules:

```bash
cd ~/jbpf_apps
./init_submodules.sh
```

### 3.2.2. Set required environment variables:

```bash
source set_vars.sh
```

### 3.2.3. There are two ways to start the srsRAN deployment:
   - with JRTC - this will create two pods, one for srsRAN, and one for JRTC.  The JRTC pod has two containers; one for the *jrt-controller* and one running the *jrt-decoder*.
   - without JRTC - This will just create a single pod, for srsRAN.

### 3.2.4. Start the srsRAN

Move to the ***jrtc-apps/containers/Helm*** directory and make sure that parameters related to local setup, such as Core IP, RRH, Local MAC Address, and VLAN ID are correctly configured.
These parameters are supplied from the Helm chart `values.yaml` (the default values are [here](./containers/Helm/values.yaml)). 

The easiest way to configure parameters related to local setup is to supply them via seperate yaml file - lets say `config.yaml`. Here is an example `config.yaml`. Please note that `config.yaml` will overwrite parameters in the `values.yaml` file.

  ```
  duConfigs:
    du1:
      cells:
        cell1:
          cellID: 1
          ruNAME: "RRH"
          ruLocalMAC: "00:11:22:33:0a:a6" 
          ruRemoteMAC: "6c:ad:ad:00:0a:a6"
          ruVLAN: "1"
          physicalCellID: 1

  cell_cfg:
    plmn: "00101"

  ngcParams:
    coreIP: 192.168.101.50 
    tac: "000001" 
    plmn: "00101" 
  ```


 Once the parameters are configured correctly we can deploy srsRAN

  
#### 3.2.4.1. Deploy RAN without jrtc:

  ```
  cd ~/jrtc-apps/containers/Helm
  ./install.sh -h . -f config.yaml
  ```

  Expected output:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n ran

  NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  srs-gnb-du1-0   3/3     Running   0          11s
  ```

#### 3.2.4.2. Deploy RAN with jrtc:

  ```
  cd ~/jrtc-apps/containers/Helm
  ./install.sh -h . -f config.yaml -f jrtc.yaml
  ```
 
  Expected output:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n ran

  NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  jrtc-0          2/2     Running   0          11s
  srs-gnb-du1-0   3/3     Running   0          11s
  ```

#### 3.2.4.3. Auto-load codelets

Codelets can be automatically loaded by providing "-c" arguments e.g.
```
  ./install.sh -h . -f config.yaml -f jrtc.yaml -c slice_mgmt/deployment.yaml -c dashboard/deployment.yaml
```

## 3.3. Running the Examples

This project includes two examples:

- [Example 1](./docs/example_no_jrtc.md):  
  Demonstrates data collection without using *jrt-controller*. It runs the [xran_packets app](./jrtc_apps/xran_packets/) that collects fronthaul statistics.  Data is streamed to a local decoder and printed on-screen.

- [Example 2](./docs/example_w_jrtc.md):  
  Demonstrates data collection using *jrt-controller*. It also runs the [xran_packets app](./jrtc_apps/xran_packets/) that collects fronthaul statistics. Data is transferred from srsRAN to *jrt-controller* via shared memory.

- [Example 3](./docs/example_dashboard.md): 
  This is an advanced example that can be used to create a dashboard collecting various statistics from RAN (including throughput, latency, loss, at various layers). 
  The application comprises of a jrt-controller app and multiple codelets. 

---

# 4. Hooks and Codelets

The available Jbpf hooks are described [here](./docs/srsran_hooks.md). Some of the codelets are documented [here](./docs/codelets.md).

# 5. RAN ZMQ mode

The RAN can also be run in __ZMQ mode__.

When running in this mode, the following additional containers are used:
- __GRC__ – GNURadio Companion
- __UEs__ – up to a maximum of 2 UEs

In ZMQ mode:
- The __gNB__ communicates with the UEs via the __GRC__ container.
- The __gNB runs exclusively in ZMQ mode__, therefore __no physical RU can be connected__.

## 5.1. UE Pods
  
A separate __pod is created for each UE.__
Each UE pod contains two containers:
- ue
  - Automatically registers the UE with the core network.
  - Establishes a PDU session to the configured APN.
- traffic
  - Starts after the UE successfully registers.
  - Automatically runs an __iperf3__ traffic test using the configured parameters.

## 5.2. ZMQ Configuration (values.yaml)

The following fields can be configured by the user in values.yaml to enable and customize ZMQ mode:

```yaml
zmq:
  enabled: False   <========= set this to True to use ZMQ mode.
  ues:
    ue1:
      tx_port: 2101
      rx_port: 2100
      imsi: "001010123456780"
      imei: "353490069873310"
      apn: "internet"
      pathloss: 0
      iperf3:
        automatic: True
        server: "192.168.100.13"
        port: 5301
        bw: "10M"
        cmd_options: "-w8M -l1320"
        duration: "10000"
        udp: True
        downlink: true
    ue2:
      tx_port: 2201
      rx_port: 2200
      imsi: "001010123456781"
      imei: "353490069873311"
      apn: "internet2"
      pathloss: 0
      iperf3:
        automatic: True
        server: "192.168.100.13"
        port: 5302
        bw: "10M"
        cmd_options: "-w8M -l1320"
        duration: "10000"
        udp: True
        downlink: true
```

## 5.3. Core updates

In order to support the above UEs, the following IMSIs need to be configured in the Core network:-
- 001010123456780
- 001010123456781

Refer to the following for more details https://docs.srsran.com/projects/project/en/latest/tutorials/source/srsUE/source/index.html#zeromq-based-setup

For credentials, refer to the __"UE config"__ files which are provided.

# 6. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** Can codelets and apps be loaded from a different server or even a different folder? 

**A:** No. At the moment, the [install.sh](./containers/Helm/install.sh) of the Helm chart maps local volumes `codelets_vol_mount` and `codelets_vol_mount` into the srsRAN and jrtc pods respectively, using a predefined folder structure. The loading process is triggered through REST but the apps and codelet source code and object files are loaded from the local volumes, not sent over REST. This is currently done for simplicity, but one can easily modify this design to fully support loading through REST API.
